# NobeFa2021-Project
I worked on a semester-long project programming a functional and secure shopping cart ecommerce
website. Used the following technologies and tools below:
- VSCode as the development tool to promote rapid development as its industry standard.
- Node JS as the backend server providing the content to the front end Javascript, EJS and HTML and CSS
were used to create a responsive interface
- Coded SQL against tables in MySQL Db which maintained our order and product information.
- Leveraged Stripe to process credit card payment information which was used in the purchase flow.
